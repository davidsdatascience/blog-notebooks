    "[Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) works as follows: suppose we have two parameters $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ and some data $x$. Our goal is to find the posterior distribution of $p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2 | x)$. To do this in a Gibbs sampling regime we need to work out the conditional distributions $p(\\theta_1 | \\theta_2, x)$ and $p(\\theta_2 | \\theta_1, x)$ (which is typically the hard part). The Gibbs updates then proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick some initial $\\theta_2^{(i)}$.\n",
    "2. Sample $\\theta_1^{(i+1)} \\sim p(\\theta_1 | \\theta_2^{(i)}, x)$\n",
    "3. Sample $\\theta_2^{(i+1)} \\sim p(\\theta_2 | \\theta_1^{(i+1)}, x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then increment $i$ and repeat $K$ times to draw $K$ samples. This is equivalent to sampling new values for a given variable *while holding all others constant*. The key thing to remember in Gibbs sampling is to always use the most recent parameter values for all samples (e.g. sample $\\theta_2^{(i+1)} \\sim p(\\theta_2 | \\theta_1^{(i+1)}, x)$ and not $\\theta_2^{(i+1)} \\sim p(\\theta_2 | \\theta_1^{(i)}, x)$ provided $\\theta_1^{(i+1)}$ has already been sampled).\n",
    "\n",
    "The massive advantage of Gibbs sampling over other MCMC methods (namely Metropolis-Hastings) is that no tuning parameters are required! The downside is the need of a fair bit of maths to derive the updates, which even then aren't always guaranteed to exist."
